Re: Christmas Toy Invoice

Below are the charges for <%= name %>'s Christmas toy order. The cost for each toy is a percentage of your home's estimated value. The cost includes delivery fee, service fee and the North Pole transportation tax. HST is separate.

=================
<%= name %>'s Toy Order
=================
<% if behavior == 'nice'%>
<% toy_hash.each do |toy, value| %>
<%= "$#{value} #{toy}" -%>
<% end %>

----
$<%= sub_total -%>  Subtotal
15%   HST
====
$<%= total %>  Total

Your total comes to $<%= total %>. Payment is due upon receipt of invoice. Should you fail to submit prompt payment we will repossess all toys in this order by January 7.  I encourage you to imagine the tantrum that will ensue should all of <%= name %>'s toys suddenly disappear.

<% else %>
$1000 Defective Toy
----
$1000  Subtotal
  15%   HST
====
$1150  Total

Your total comes to $1150. Payment is due upon receipt of invoice. Should you fail to submit prompt payment we will repossess all toys in this order by January 7.  I encourage you to imagine the tantrum that will ensue should all of <%= name %>'s toys suddenly disappear.

P.S. For a limited time get 25% off the best-seller by Ms. Claus, Iâ€™m Getting Nothing for Christmas: Raising Toy-Worthy Children in a Device-Driven World.
