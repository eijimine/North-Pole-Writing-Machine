Re: Christmas Toy Invoice

Below are the charges for <%= name %>'s Christmas toy order. The cost for each toy is a percentage of your home's estimated value. The cost includes delivery fee, service fee and the North Pole transportation tax. HST is separate.

=================
<%= name %>'s Toy Order
=================

<% toy_hash.each do |toy, value| %>
<%= "$#{value} #{toy}" -%>
<% end %>
----
<%= sub_total -%>  Subtotal
$<%= hst %>   HST
====
$<%= total %>  Total

Your total comes to $<%= total %>. Payment is due upon receipt of invoice. Should you fail to submit prompt payment we will repossess all toys in this order by January 7.  I encourage you to imagine the tantrum that will ensue should all of <%= name %>'s toys suddenly disappear.

Due to a high number of NSF incidents we no longer accept personal cheques. Please make all payments through PayPal, Interac e-transfer or certified cheque.

Sincerely,

Guido the Elf,
Collections Department
Santa's Village
